# embeddingsPPI: Binary protein-protien interaction prediction with unsupervised learning embeddings

# Example Project

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are the main mechanism by which proteins carry out their functions.  A better ability predict if two proteins will interact can be

## Notes:
To replicated the PPIDB, HuRI psi files for HI-05, HI-14, and HuRI must be downloaded from the HuRI website and placed in the HuRI folder in ppiDB.  Similarly, the HIPPIE dataset must be downloaded and placed in the HIPPIE folder.  These files were not uploaded due to size restraints.
